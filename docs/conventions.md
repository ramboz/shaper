# Conventions: shaper

> Each rule below uses the format: **Rule** → **Why:** → **How to apply:**.
> Add rules as the project encounters real decisions worth recording.

## Documentation

**Rule:** Every wizard-generated doc carries a `Status: Draft (wizard-generated)` marker at the top.
**Why:** Distinguishes generated stubs from deliberate content, so reviewers and agents know what is authoritative.
**How to apply:** scaffold-init adds this marker. Flip it to `Status: Stable` after 3–5 reconciled specs have validated the doc structure (via a `scaffold-stable` ADR).

**Rule:** Deferred decisions are explicit, not silent.
**Why:** Silent gaps get forgotten. Explicit `Deferred` markers turn unknowns into trackable items.
**How to apply:** Use a `> **Deferred — <reason>.**` blockquote in the section. Add a corresponding entry to `docs/refinement-todo.md` with a resolution trigger.

## Specs

**Rule:** Every non-trivial change starts with a spec, SPIDR-split into vertical slices.
**Why:** Specs as contracts at the right granularity let humans and agents work in parallel without constant re-alignment.
**How to apply:** Run `/jig:spec-workflow` (when implemented), or write `docs/specs/NNN-<slug>/spec.md` by hand using the SPIDR template. Each slice must touch the user-facing layer (no horizontal phasing).

## Code style

> **Deferred — no signal from initial scaffold.** Will be filled in as the project
> encounters style decisions worth recording. Each addition follows the
> Rule/Why/How format above.

## Testing

> **Deferred — no test framework decided yet.** Will be filled in once the first
> spec requires tests beyond ad-hoc verification.

## Git

> **Deferred — commit message format and branch naming not yet decided.**
