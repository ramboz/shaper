# Spec 001: Adopt jig

## Overview

This is the worked-example spec that `scaffold-init` seeds into a fresh
project so the very first turn has a faithful pattern to imitate. It
records the genuine first unit of work in `shaper`: adopting
jig by running `scaffold-init` to lay down the docs tree, AGENTS.md, the
status board, and the runtime machinery under `.codex/`.

It is **real, permanent project history**, not a labelled-deletable
demo. Scaffolding genuinely was the first thing that happened here, so
`001-adopt-jig` stays. Read [slice-01-bootstrap.md](slice-01-bootstrap.md)
for the full slice shape — Goal, DoR, Acceptance Criteria, DoD,
anti-horizontal-phasing check, and a short real deviation log — and use
it as the template for your own slices.

The next spec, [002-release-plan-handoff](../002-release-plan-handoff/spec.md),
is a `DRAFT` spec for shaper's first real product workflow.

## Decomposition

**SPIDR axis: Interface.** Adoption is a one-shot interface change: the
project goes from "no workflow scaffold" to "jig docs + machinery
present and wired." A single vertical slice delivers it end-to-end.

### Slices

1. **`001-01 bootstrap`** — Run `scaffold-init` so the project opens
   with the jig docs tree, AGENTS.md, an honest status board, and the
   `.codex/` runtime machinery. DONE — see
   [slice-01-bootstrap.md](slice-01-bootstrap.md).
