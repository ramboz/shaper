# Workflow: shaper

## How we build

Spec-driven development with SPIDR slicing, independent review, and reconciliation.

## Spec lifecycle

```
DRAFT → READY_FOR_REVIEW → READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION → IN_PROGRESS
  → REVIEWED → RECONCILED → DONE
```

## SPIDR splitting

All non-trivial specs are SPIDR-split before implementation:

- **S — Spike**: last resort, only when none of P/I/D/R apply
- **P — Path**: split by alternative paths (happy path first)
- **I — Interface**: split by UI/platform/channel (minimal first)
- **D — Data**: split by data subset (less data first)
- **R — Rules**: split by business rules (simple first)

**Anti-horizontal-phasing rule:** every slice must touch the user-facing layer
and deliver end-to-end value.

## Session workflow

1. Check `docs/specs/README.md` for current status board.
2. Pick up next `READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION` slice.
3. Spawn the `implementer` subagent with the spec path.
4. After the deliverable is on disk, run the post-implementation review (three passes — see below).
5. Address findings; `[blocker]`-tagged craft/arch entries block the REVIEWED transition, `[nit]`-tagged ones become reconciliation-log items.
6. Reconcile: update docs, write deviation log, run reconciliation review.
7. Run `/jig:memory-sync` to consolidate learnings.
8. Update spec status to DONE.

## Post-implementation review

Every slice runs up to three review passes between IN_PROGRESS and REVIEWED:

1. **Compliance** — `jig:independent-review` (always). Spec-AC check by a fresh reviewer subagent.
2. **Craft** — `pr-review` (always). Routes to the most-specific installed skill (user > project > `jig:pr-review`).
3. **Architecture** — `arch-review` (on-demand). Runs only when the slice's frontmatter declares `arch_review: true`. Same precedence as craft.

Order: compliance → craft → (arch if flagged). All required passes must `pass` for REVIEWED.

### Review evidence gates the transition

Each pass produces a durable verdict artifact — these gates are mechanical,
not honour-system prose, and no `Stop` hook is involved:

1. Build the prompt (`review.py implementation` / `pr-review` / `arch-review`)
   and spawn the reviewer.
2. Record the verdict:

   ```bash
   python3 ${CODEX_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}/.codex/skills/jig-independent-review/review.py \
     record-review docs/specs/NNN-slug/spec.md "<slice>" \
     --pass compliance --verdict pass --reviewer jig:reviewer \
     --prompt-source "review.py implementation ..." --summary-file verdict.md
   ```

   This writes `docs/specs/NNN-slug/reviews/slice-NN-<pass>.md`
   (`<pass>` ∈ compliance / craft / arch / reconciliation).
3. Run the gated transition:

   ```bash
   python3 ${CODEX_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}/.codex/skills/jig-spec-workflow/workflow.py \
     transition docs/specs/NNN-slug/spec.md "<slice>" REVIEWED
   ```

`workflow.py transition` **refuses** REVIEWED / RECONCILED / DONE unless the
required verdicts exist and carry `verdict: pass` (RECONCILED also needs a
`### Deviation log` subsection; DONE re-validates the full set plus
`dependencies:`). A refusal names the missing artifact and the
`record-review` command. The gate enforces evidence consistency, not human
sign-off — it lives in the agent's trust boundary, so a deliberate
out-of-band flow can bypass it with `JIG_REVIEW_EVIDENCE_GATE=0`.

**Recovering from a failed review:** address findings, re-run the pass,
`record-review` again (overwrites the earlier file for that `(slice, pass)`
in place — git history keeps the prior verdict), then re-run the transition.

## Stocktake

After every few reconciled slices, review what was deferred during scaffolding to see if any items now have signal:

```bash
python3 ${CODEX_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}/.codex/skills/jig-scaffold-init/stocktake.py .
```

The stocktake reports:
- Number of slices in `STATUS: DONE` or `STATUS: RECONCILED`
- Deferred items from `docs/refinement-todo.md`, grouped by category
- A promotion suggestion when ≥3 slices have reconciled — review which items can now be promoted to specs or ADRs

This is a `skill, not a hook` (per slice 001-04 design): it requires judgment about which deferred items are now ripe. Run it manually as part of a reconciliation step, or whenever you want a snapshot.

## Hook Strictness Profiles

jig hooks support three enforcement levels via the `SCAFFOLD_HOOK_PROFILE` env var:

- **minimal** — telemetry only, no blocking
- **standard** — blocks on spec gates and reconciliation; warns on contract changes
- **strict** — blocks on everything including style/lint failures

> **Deferred — `SCAFFOLD_HOOK_PROFILE` is not yet read by any hook.** The default
> behavior is currently fixed (equivalent to `standard`). Implementation lives in
> a future jig slice. Set the env var in advance to express intent; effective
> enforcement will catch up once the dispatch logic ships.
